# Python modules help organize code and add functionality. They are categorized into built-in modules, which come with the Python interpreter, and external modules, which are developed by the community and must be installed separately

# PIP (which recursively stands for "Pip Installs Packages") is the standard package manager for Python. It is a command-line tool that allows you to install, manage, and uninstall software packages (libraries and modules) that are not part of the standard python library
